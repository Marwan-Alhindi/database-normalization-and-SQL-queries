In the scope of this project, I successfully identified and rectified errors within a database. Subsequently, I meticulously normalized the database adhering to the principles of the First Normal Form (1NF), Second Normal Form (2NF), and Third Normal Form (3NF). This process enhanced the database's structural integrity and optimized its efficiency.
